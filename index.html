        <h4>By Marfa Sergiyenko</h4>

        <h2>Where is Ukraine?</h2>

        <p>Ukraine is an eastern European country, located on the border with Russia. Its neighbouring countries include Poland, Belarus, Slovakia, Hungary, Romania and Moldova. It has a coastline with the Sea of Azov and the Black Sea. Ukraine is the second largest country in Europe in terms of size - around 233,062 square mile - placing behind Russia. The country was formerly part of the Soviet Union after joining the country after the second world war. Ukraine as we know it today became independent upon the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991.</p>
        <h2>What happened to Ukraine?</h2>
        <p>Russia’s invasion of Ukraine is entering a new phase. After fierce resistance from the Ukrainian military, Russian President Vladimir Putin’s forces have pivoted to consolidate their positions toward the south and east of the country as they begin a fresh offensive, bombing residential areas and civilian targets.  Ukraine has meanwhile uncovered what it says is evidence of war crimes committed in Bucha and other towns near Kyiv while under Russian control. Russian attacks on population centers have driven four million people out of Ukraine.</p>
        <h2>What is Kharkiv?</h2>

        <p>Kharkiv is a city in northeastern Ukraine. It lies at the confluence of the Uda, Lopan, and Kharkiv rivers. It was founded about 1655 as a military stronghold to protect Russia’s southern borderlands; part of the old kremlin wall survives. The centre of a region of fertile soils and rapid colonization in the 18th century, it quickly developed important trade and handicraft manufactures and became a seat of provincial government in 1732. Currently is one of the biggest Ukrainian cities under Russian bombing. Known are the city of universities and knowledge before the war.</p>
        <h2>What is the national cuisine of Ukraine?</h2>

        <ul>
            <li><strong id="borscht">Borscht</strong> - beloved red beetroot soup is definitely a <em>must-try</em> in Ukraine.</li>
            <li><strong>Varenyky</strong> - the Ukrainian version of the popular Central and Eastern European <em>pierogi</em>.</li>
            <li><strong>Solyanka</strong> - <em>traditional</em> meat soup, made with different types of meat like beef, ham, bacon, sausage, and chicken.</li>
            <li><strong>Okroshka</strong> - traditional <em>cold</em> summer soup made with mostly raw vegetables like cucumber, radish, and spring onion mixed with kvas, boiled potatoes, eggs, sour cream, and dill.</li>
            <li><strong>Korovai</strong> - an elaborately decorated type of bread that plays a vital role in the <em>wedding traditions</em> of Ukraine, Russia, Poland, Bulgaria, and Romania.</li>

        <h2>What is Ukraine known for?</h2>
        <p>It is this that has earned Ukraine the nickname “the breadbasket of Europe’ and it has the ability to provide food for at half a billion people. Around 32 million hectares of land is cultivated every year and crops form the bulk of Ukraine’s national exports. In 2019 Ukraine ranked number 51 in the world in terms of total export value, but it is truly a world leader in terms of agricultural exports. Ukraine produces 18% of the world’s sunflower seed, safflower or cottonseed oil exports; 13% of corn production; 12% of global barley exports; and 8% of wheat and meslin. In absolute figures, corn is the largest Ukrainian export market and brings in a massive $4.77 billion every year. Seed oils ($3.75bn), iron ore ($3.36bn) and wheat ($3.11bn) are also major export markets for Ukraine. The only European country to rival Ukraine in the production of crops like wheat, corn and sunflower is Russia. As such the ongoing invasion of Ukraine poses a serious threat to the vital supply of stable foods which much of the world relies on. The fighting disrupts the usual process of cultivating, harvesting, selling and transporting the crops that are so vital both for the Ukrainian economy and for nutritional demands of nations all over the world. Russia too will experience disruption to its crop production if the invasion is prolonged and is also receiving severe economic sanctions at the moment.
